                <p>In 2020, when the world stopped turning due to Covid-19, my company switched to fully remote work. I loved it. However, once the weather got nicer and pandemic fears subsided, I felt couped up.</p>
                <p>I began spending 1-2 days a week out at cafes, breweries, bookshops - anywhere that had WiFi and was accepting patrons.</p> 
                <p>And I wasn't alone. I saw hundreds of like-minded digital nomads wishing to switch it up and escape their bedroom office. After many weeks of using Google maps and walking somewhere to check if they had a suitable work environment, I knew there was a missing link between workers looking for exciting places to work remotely and the places designed to host them.</p>
