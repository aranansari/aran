                <p>
                Small businesses have limited access to capital. Any funds the can raise will be high-cost and personally guaranteed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Apart from purchasing the good or service, local stakeholders have no way to support Small Businesses they care about.

            <div id ="text"style="text-align:right !important;" >
            <p>    A two-sided marketplace where businesses fundraise and offer competitive ROIs and investors can contribute to their local economy directly and earn interest while doing so.</p>

                <b><i>July 2019</i></b> -  Joined as an intern after graduating college and theorizing a similar business (discovered Mainvest during my own market research).
                <br>
                <b><i>Sept 2019</i></b> - Moved into a full time Operations role focusing on growth strategy on the supply (smb) side of the marketplace. Onboarding hundreds of Small Businesses, streamlining the processes, and working on the ground to pitch and assist the entrepreneurs.
                <br>
                <b><i>February 2021</i></b> - Using my knowledge of the supply side of the business, I transitioned to Product Manager to be the much needed liaison between Ops and Tech. Mixing data analysis and qualitative user research to inform changes to 90% of the user-facing platform. Dabbling in UI design, copywriting, and coding, I was often referred to as the pinch-hitter of the small, 20 person team.
