                <p>Hi! I'm Aran Ansari and I'm currently 25 years old and living a Digital Nomad lifestyle (currently in Somerville, MA). I was born and raised in Belmont, MA with two older sisters and amazing parents.

                My father is an Iranian-born psychiatrist, and is the most logical thinker I've ever known. My mother is a Venezuelan-born translator/paralegal/painter, who happens to be the most creative person I've ever known! Being brought up in this unique and eclectic household meant I developed a balance of rationale and intuition. A perfect split down the middle of left-brain and right-brain.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love being outside, listening to music, cooking, being active 



                For college I attended University of Massachusetts, Amherst for the Isenberg School of Business. There I majored in Finance, learning the ins-and-outs of Excel spreadsheets and Income Statements. I was also able to pursue a minor in Economics - where I was radicalized into Marxism and Capitalism equally - and Information Technology - where I began my habit of being the worst coder in a room full of great engineers. I knew I didn't want to pursue the conventional path my business school was nudging me towards, Big 4 Accounting school and gruntwork in cubicles, which meant many of the roles I found were outside of school.

                My first notable internship was an unpaid one at a NYC startup called Gigzolo (acq. Glia), which was a marketplace for live event entertainment booking. Hosts could come on Gigzolo and book a wedding band, hoola hooper, or breakdancing troupe, and my role at the company was to onboard these bands - the supply side of the marketplace.
